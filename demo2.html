 Resource utilisation:Land areas, 
water resources,forests are over exploited. The growing population could pose a
threat to already existing ecosystem, as the number increases 
consumption increases which puts stress on natural
resources which could lead to shortage of water and food.
Decreased production and increased costs: Food production and
distribution have not been able to catch up with the increasing
population and hence the costs of production have increased. 
Inflation is the major consequence of over population.
Inequitable income distribution: In the face of an increasing 
population, there is an unequal distribution of income and inequalities
within the country widen. Due to excessive number of individuals,
the job is not valued appropriately which could significantly bring 
down the value of the skill.</p>
